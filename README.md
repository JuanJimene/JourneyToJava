# JourneyToJava
A short video game made in Java with AWT GUI components. Made as a class project for UNF 'Programming 2' in Spring 2022.  

This project was made as a class final project for OOP Java Programming (Programming 2) in UNF by me (Juan Jimenez 'JuanJimene'). 

IMPORTANT : To start the game just run the JourneyGUI.java file in your IDE. This file will call the other two classes "gameMusic.java" and "startGame.java"
to begin the game. The game uses only the keyboard arrow keys and the goal is to get from the starting area (The UNF Parking Garage) to Mr.Piersall's classroom 
(Building 15). At any moment, if the user presses the spacebar, the current location of the character will be output to the console, this was done for testing purposes 
while I was developing the borders of the backgrounds.
